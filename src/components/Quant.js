        <h2>What is Quantitative Finance?</h2>
        <p className="lead">
          Quantitative Finance, often referred to as "Quant Finance," involves the use of mathematical models, computational techniques, and statistical methods to analyze financial markets and securities. 
          Quantitative Analysts, or "Quants," work in investment banks, hedge funds, asset management firms, and proprietary trading firms. The field encompasses topics like risk management, algorithmic trading, derivatives pricing, portfolio optimization, and high-frequency trading.

        <h3>Key Topics in Quantitative Finance:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Analyzing and managing financial risks, often through Value-at-Risk (VaR) models, stress testing, and scenario analysis.</li>
          <li><strong>Derivatives Pricing:</strong> Using models like Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulations to price financial derivatives, including options and futures.</li>
          <li><strong>Algorithmic Trading:</strong> Developing automated systems that execute trades based on predefined rules and market data.</li>
          <li><strong>Statistical Arbitrage:</strong> Exploiting pricing inefficiencies between related securities using statistical models.</li>
          <li><strong>Portfolio Optimization:</strong> Balancing a portfolio to maximize returns for a given level of risk using techniques like Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).</li>
          <li><strong>Machine Learning in Finance:</strong> Applying machine learning techniques to forecast prices, manage risk, and optimize trading strategies.</li>
