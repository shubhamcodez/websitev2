          <h4>1. Coin Toss Problem</h4>
          <p><strong>Problem:</strong> What is the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin tosses?</p>
          <details>
            <summary>Solution</summary>
            <p>Using the binomial probability formula: P(X=k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)</p>
            <p>P(X=3) = C(5,3) * (0.5)^3 * (0.5)^2 = 10 * 0.125 * 0.25 = 0.3125</p>
            <p>Answer: 31.25%</p>

          <h4>2. Monty Hall Problem</h4>
          <p><strong>Problem:</strong> In a game show, you pick one of three doors. Behind one is a car, behind the others are goats. After you pick, the host opens a door with a goat. Should you switch?</p>
          <details>
            <summary>Solution</summary>
            <p>Yes, you should switch. The probability of winning increases from 1/3 to 2/3 when you switch.</p>

          <h4>3. Mean vs Median</h4>
          <p><strong>Problem:</strong> In a dataset, the mean is 50 and the median is 45. What can you infer about the distribution?</p>
          <details>
            <summary>Solution</summary>
            <p>The distribution is right-skewed (positively skewed). When mean &gt; median, the distribution has a long right tail.</p>

          <h4>4. Standard Deviation</h4>
          <p><strong>Problem:</strong> If you add 10 to every value in a dataset, what happens to the standard deviation?</p>
          <details>
            <summary>Solution</summary>
            <p>The standard deviation remains unchanged. Adding a constant to all values only shifts the distribution, it doesn't change the spread.</p>

          <p><strong>Problem:</strong> You can invest $1000 in a stock that has a 60% chance of returning 20% and a 40% chance of losing 10%. What's the expected return?</p>
          <details>
            <summary>Solution</summary>
            <p>Expected return = (0.6 × 0.2) + (0.4 × -0.1) = 0.12 - 0.04 = 0.08 = 8%</p>

            <p>Hour hand: 3 × 30° + 15° × 0.5° = 90° + 7.5° = 97.5°</p>

            <p>Unfold the cube into a net. The shortest path is a straight line across the unfolded surface.</p>
