      <h2>What is Quantitative Finance?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Quantitative Finance, often referred to as "Quant Finance," involves the use of mathematical models, computational techniques, and statistical methods to analyze financial markets and securities. 
        Quantitative Analysts, or "Quants," work in investment banks, hedge funds, asset management firms, and proprietary trading firms. The field encompasses topics like risk management, algorithmic trading, derivatives pricing, portfolio optimization, and high-frequency trading. 
      </p>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h3>Key Topics in Quantitative Finance:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Analyzing and managing financial risks, often through Value-at-Risk (VaR) models, stress testing, and scenario analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Derivatives Pricing:</strong> Using models like Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulations to price financial derivatives, including options and futures.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithmic Trading:</strong> Developing automated systems that execute trades based on predefined rules and market data.</li>
        <li><strong>Statistical Arbitrage:</strong> Exploiting pricing inefficiencies between related securities using statistical models.</li>
        <li><strong>Portfolio Optimization:</strong> Balancing a portfolio to maximize returns for a given level of risk using techniques like Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).</li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning in Finance:</strong> Applying machine learning techniques to forecast prices, manage risk, and optimize trading strategies.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h3>Different Roles in Quantitative Finance:</h3>
      <p>Quant Finance offers a range of career opportunities depending on your skill set and interest. Here are some common roles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quantitative Analyst (Quant Analyst):</strong> Responsible for developing and validating mathematical models for pricing derivatives, risk management, and financial forecasting. Requires strong mathematical, programming, and statistical skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantitative Developer (Quant Developer):</strong> Specializes in implementing and optimizing algorithms, trading platforms, and financial models. Quant developers often collaborate with traders and analysts to develop high-performance systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithmic Trader:</strong> A specialized role that focuses on developing and managing trading strategies, often using high-frequency trading algorithms to take advantage of market inefficiencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantitative Researcher:</strong> Focuses on researching new trading strategies, developing quantitative models, and conducting backtesting. Quant researchers often hold advanced degrees in mathematics, physics, computer science, or related fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Manager:</strong> Uses quantitative methods to assess and mitigate risk within a portfolio or trading strategy. This role is critical in ensuring that firms remain compliant with regulatory standards and manage their risk exposure effectively.</li>
